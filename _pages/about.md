I am a final-year Computer Science Ph.D student at the University of Tennessee Knoxville, advised by [Dr. Jack Dongarra](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X4SbSTAAAAAJ&hl=en).  
I also serve as a graduate research assistant at the [Innovative Computing Laboratory](https://icl.utk.edu/).

I am currently preparing to defend my dissertation, titled "Randomized Algorithms for Low
and Full-Rank Decompositions, and Their Implementations in RandLAPACK" in the Fall semester 2025.
